Best results can be seen for the Decision Tree model and the worst are for linear regression. The possible reason for the poor performance of the linear regression model is due to multicolinearity amongst the variables.

The Repository contains the following:

1. Jupyter Notebook, containing the solution of the problem statement.
2. Dataset for the probelem
3. README.md file
